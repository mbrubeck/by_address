# by_address

Rust wrapper type that implements hashing and comparison based on address
rather than value.

* [crates.io package](https://crates.io/crates/by_address)
* [Source code](https://github.com/mbrubeck/by_address)

# Overview

`ByAddress` can be used to wrap any pointer type (i.e. any type that implements the Deref
trait).  This includes references, raw pointers, smart pointers like `Rc<T>`
and `Box<T>`, and specialized pointer-like types such as `Vec<T>` and `String`.

The wrapped pointer implements the following traits based on the address of
its contents, rather than their value:

* Hash
* Eq, PartialEq
* Ord, PartialOrd

## no_std

This crate does not depend on libstd, so it can be used in [`no_std`]
projects.
